## Introduction
In this tutorial we’ll create a few blog posts and list them on our demo Bakery Store site.
Creating a post
Blog posts live in the _posts directory. Each post is stored in its own file. The file name of a post is important, the beginning has the date when the post was or will be published, then there’s a title and finally an extension. By default, blog posts are commonly written in Markdown but can also be written in HTML. We’ll create a new file for our first post: _posts/2016-04-03-chocolate-chip-cookies.md.
In our post we’ll start with empty front matter. We need this empty front matter to tell Jekyll that this isn’t a static file. Then we’ll add our Markdown content:

The chocolate chip cookie was invented by Ruth Graves Wakefield. She owned the Toll House Inn, in Whitman, Massachusetts, a very popular restaurant that featured home cooking in the 1930s. Her cookbook, Toll House Tried and True Recipes, was first published in 1936 by M. Barrows &amp; Company, New York. The 1938 edition of the cookbook was the first to include the recipe "Toll House Chocolate Crunch Cookie" which rapidly became a favorite cookie in American homes.

We’ll repeat this for another post, _posts/2016-04-04-sourdough-bread.md:

Sourdough bread is made by the fermentation of dough using naturally-occurring lactobacilli and yeast. Sourdough bread has a mildly sour taste not present in most breads made with baker's yeast and better inherent keeping qualities than other breads, due to the lactic acid produced by the lactobacilli.
